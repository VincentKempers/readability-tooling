# Readability tool
Made a readability tool in Dutch with unified and retext. This is based on the sentence how hard it is to read. I will be testing this project on the basis of checking it with people who are low literate. This means it will only be used to get a global understanding of..

> Could these algorithms around determine what's hard for low literate.

&

> Is there a median that we can approve on that low literacy is a fact.

After deducting this my research can continue and I will have a prove of concept (Which already is). After being confirmed I can use this "median" for my future studies.
